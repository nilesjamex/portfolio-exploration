    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>
      I am a software developer based in Ibadan, Nigeria with a passion for
      crafting visually stunning and interactive digital experiences. My
      expertise lies in CSS, animation, and user interaction design, and I am
      always striving to improve my skills and push the boundaries of what is
      possible. As a developer, I find great satisfaction in simplifying complex
      code and making it more efficient, and I am always on the lookout for new
      and innovative ways to solve problems.
